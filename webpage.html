<h4 style="color:red">logging of nature</h4>
<p>"If we start to understand the value of nature to our society and economy,<br> 
    we will recognise the importance of living in harmony with nature, rather<br> 
    than destroying it for short term gain.  So many governments and businesses<br>
    around the world are now realising this, and starting to act – it gives me <br>
    real hope for the future."<br>

<p><em>hangging with NATURE</em>
<p>Whether it's watching blue, rolling waves crash against the sandy shore <br>
   or hearing birds chirping in a green, luscious forest, there is something<br>
   so remarkable and beautiful about being immersed in nature. It’s easy to be<br>
   swept away with today’s technology and fast-paced living, but no matter where<br>
   you are, nature always has a way of bringing peace to the mind and grounding a <br>
   person.<br>
